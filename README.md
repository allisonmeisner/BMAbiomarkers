# BMAbiomarkers
R code for using BMA methods to develop biomarker combinations

The file `BMAbiomarkers.R` provides `R` code for the primary analysis presented in "Development of Biomarker Combinations for Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury via Bayesian Model Selection in a Multicenter Cohort Study." This analysis involves using Bayesian modeling average (BMA) methods to construct combinations of biomarkers.

__Note:__ This code was tailored the code for the data at hand (see the paper for a description). The user of this code should check each line to ensure that it is appropriate for his/her data. In addition, the user should be aware that aspects of his/her data may complicate the analysis and/or require modifications to sections of the code.
